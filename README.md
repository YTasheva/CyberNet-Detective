## Overview

### The Challenge
  
- Built an interactive front-end application called CyberNet Detective. The cyber security APIs we've used helped us create 'Call Tracker' and 'IP Tracker' which provide easy access to extensive data from reputable sources such as public records information, government database and Satalite(SAT) data.  billions of show visitors if they are  using IPv4 or IPv6 address if one is detected. The app unlocks new possibilities in geolocation, geofencing in websites, detecting fraudulent activity, improving marketing ROI, helps with price and currency optimization and automatic form filling. As a resoult it can help businesses with sales and revenue. Better user experience on websites will lead to better user engagement.

This repository is about creating an application to locate an IP address, called 'IP Tracker' and Reverse call lookup named 'Call Tracker'. This is our first group project for our web development program. 

The CyberNet Detective application will give detailed information about an IP address and search who called or texted with reverse phone lookup. It can help find who is behind a phone number or IP address, search for contact information and not the least to protect from spammers, scammers and frauds. The user has the ability to input a phone number or an IP address, the final report and search results will produce a list of IP and caller's data (including spam detection) that are applicable. Just to name a few, additional functionality includes a map identifying the location results, any aliases used by them, any known services running on that IP, the area code for that region, the country it's in, and a responsive interface.

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated Bootstrap, HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code and APIs. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 
  
### Acceptance Criteria

* The app should provide the option to access caller details and an IP address with easy and reveal the identity of the person on the other end. Users should be able to identify callers and information about an IP address, whether itâ€™s known for spam, brute-force attacks, bot-nets, VPN endpoints, data centre endpoints, and more.
 
  * Call Tracker, IP Tracker and Contact Form should contain buttons to submit.
    
  * When an button is clicked, a modal with the terms of use appears.
   
  * If agreed it should display their report results. 

* Inside your Bootstrap-Home Page repo, create the folder structure for the webpage.

* Application deployed at live URL.

* Application loads with no errors.

* Application GitHub URL submitted.

* GitHub repository that contains application code.

* Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.

* The application user interface style is clean, polished and responsive.

* The application should be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources)

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Have a clear and easy UI whilst still aesthetically pleasing.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

* Using GitHub Project to track the status of your project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.

* To implement feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.

* Use Presentation to address:

  *  Elevator pitch

  * Concept - What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
   
  * Process - What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
  
  * Demo
  
  * Directions for future development

### Built With

- Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, APIs

### Using the app

- To begin using the app, type the phone number or the IP address you would like to find more information. On our page 'IP Tracker' we've explained in detail on how to locate an IP address in order to input it in the form. Click the button "Get IP details" or "Search" button to generate the report. A modal stating that the 'Results are ready' will appear, asking for the client's agreement with the Terms of use. 

Ip Tracker - A short report will be given on the left handside. For a more extensive report at the bottom of the form is located a button called 'Details' which will generate further twenty four data resources.

Call Tracker - A phone number and a country code are required in order to generate the search. Press on the "Search " button to see the results.
