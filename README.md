## Overview

### The Challenge
  
-  Build an interactive front-end  Call Tracker/ IP Tracker application and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.
 This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated Bootstrap, HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code and APIs. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 
  
### Acceptance Criteria

* The app should provide the option to access caller details and an IP address with easy and reveal the identity of the person on the other end. Users should be able to identify callers and information about an IP address, whether itâ€™s known for spam, brute-force attacks, bot-nets, VPN endpoints, data centre endpoints, and more.
 
  * Call Tracker, IP Tracker and Contact Form should contain buttons to submit.
    
  * When an button is clicked, a modal with the terms of use appears.
   
  * If agreed it should display their report results. 

* Inside your Bootstrap-Home Page repo, create the folder structure for the webpage.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score.

* Application deployed at live URL.

* Application loads with no errors.

* Application GitHub URL submitted.

* GitHub repository that contains application code.

* Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.

* The application user interface style is clean, polished and responsive.

* The application should be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources)

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Have a clear and easy UI whilst still aesthetically pleasing.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

* Using GitHub Project to track the status of your project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.

* To implement feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.

* Use Presentation to address:

  *  Elevator pitch

  * Concept - What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
   
  * Process - What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
  
  * Demo
  
  * Directions for future development
